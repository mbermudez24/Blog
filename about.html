            <h2>About my Blog</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="preserve">
                This blog was born as an ambitious initiative, an opportunity to apply and strengthen my newly acquired
                knowledge in HTML and CSS, courtesy of X Academy. My main motivation was clear: to create a challenging
                but achievable project that would allow me to move step by step towards my dream of becoming an expert
                in web and application development.

                The starting point was the careful definition of the blog structure. From the header to the footer, each
                element was precisely planned in HTML. The choice of colors came next, with a simple but striking
                palette for each section of the blog. Next, I turned my attention to the design, facing challenges such
                as the implementation of a background image with a transparency effect, which, after transparency
                effect, which, after diligent research, I managed to solve successfully.

                My learning journey has been immensely rewarding. From the basics of HTML to the complexity of CSS
                properties, I have experienced substantial growth. From tags to advanced layout manipulation using divs,
                from changing the color of text to mastering concepts such as flexbox and grid, the mastery of concepts
                such as flexbox and grid, my background has expanded considerably.

                As for my aspirations for the future of this project, I envision the incorporation of JavaScript as the
                next big step. As I move forward with my courses at Academia X, I plan to expand and enrich the blog
                with new the blog with new features. My goals span a broad spectrum, from mastering technologies such as
                React, PostgreSQL, Node.js and Express, to venturing into Python and Django. This blog is just the
                beginning of my journey, and I'm ready to face challenges and learn even more.

                My dreams go beyond programming. I want to offer the best possible life to my parents, explore the
                world, absorb knowledge from all possible sources and achieve a master's degree in software engineering.
                My goal is to achieve such a level of excellence that my work will give me the flexibility to fully
                enjoy life. This blog is just the beginning of an exciting journey towards the realization of those
                dreams.
